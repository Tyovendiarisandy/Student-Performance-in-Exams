Tes ini sering disebut dengan tes  SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) atau lebih spesifik SAT Reasoning Test yang bertujuan untuk mengukur pengetahuan siswa tentang matematika, membaca, dan menulis, serta kesiapan mereka untuk kuliah[[1]](https://www.bestcolleges.com/test-prep/sat/what-is-sat/)[[2]](https://leapscholar.com/blog/sat-reasoning-test-everything-you-need-to-know/). Tes SAT umumnya secara luas digunakan sebagai salah satu tes standar untuk penerimaan perguruan tinggi di Amerika Serikat. Akan tetapi, negara lain seperti Kanada, Singapura, Hongkong, Jerman, dan Australia juga menggunakan tes SAT untuk penerimaan masuk ke perguruan tinggi.\n","\n","**Problem Statement**\n","\n","Bagaimana kemampuan matematis, membaca, dan menulis siswa berdasarkan hasil tes SAT dari dataset yang digunakan?\n","\n","**Goals**\n","- Menemukan insight dari pola-pola atau faktor-faktor yang saling berkaitan dari siswa yang mendapatkan skor SAT yang tinggi dengan yang rendah.\n","- Membuat mesin prediksi agar dapat menentukan apakah siswa lulus tes SAT atau tidak berdasarkan perolehan skor matematika, membaca, dan menulis.\n","\n","**Analytical Approach**\n","\n","Pendekatan yang digunakan yaitu:\n","  1.
